# bash for Libertine Linux

## License

* The license for this package is MIT.
* The license for the upstream source is GPL2; its library is LGPL2.1.

## Notes

* There is no git repository for bc, so the tarball 1.06 was downloaded from <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bc/bc-1.06.tar.gz>
* bc is needed as part of the build process as the Linux kernel build (linux_prep package) depends on it
* It would be nice if bc could become a BusyBox applet
